History of Java
===============
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be control by a remote like setup box.
That time project was called Stealth project and later it was renamed to Green project.

James gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project and they have met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start with work with Graphic System. James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project.But the problem what they have faced is , C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language which is system independent.

In 1991, They have developed one programming language called an OAK. OAK means strength, itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many 
countries like Germany, France, USA and etc.

Later in 1995, They have renamed OAK to Java. Java is island of an Indonasia
where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.


Identifiers
============
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be variable, method name, class name or label name.

ex:
	class  Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int  i = 10;

			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}

	Here Test, main , args and i are identifiers.

Rules to declare an identifiers
--------------------------------
Rule1:
------
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$
Rule2:
-----
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  empId; //valid 
		int  emp_id; //valid
		int  emp$sal; //valid
		int  dept#No; //invalid  

Rule3:
----
	Every identifier must and should starts with alphabet, underscore or 
	dollar symbol but not with digits.
	ex:
		int  a1234; //valid 
		int  _abcd; //valid 
		int  $=20;  //valid  
		int  1abcd; //invalid 
Rule4:
------
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int number;
		int NUMBER;
		int NumBer;

Rule5:
------
	We can't take reserved words as an identifier.	
	ex:
		int  if; //invalid 
		int  for; //invalid
		int public; //invalid 

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifier but it is not recommanded
	to take more then 15 characters.

Rule7:
-----
	Identifier can be alpha numeric character also.
	ex:
		int  emp_Id1;

Reserved Words
=============
There are some identifiers which are reserved to associate some functionality or meaning such type of identifiers are called reserved words.

Java supports 53 reserved words.

All reserved words we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

In java reserved words are divided into two types.
