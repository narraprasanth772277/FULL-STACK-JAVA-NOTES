Naming conventions in java
==========================
In java, uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters
will consider as different.Hence we consider Java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive , we must and should follow naming conventions for
following things.

ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables
	methods
	keywords
	packages  and 
	constants 

classes
--------
In java , A class name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined classes		userdefined classes
	----------------		--------------------
	System				Test
	StringBuffer			TestApp
	File				DemoApp
	FileWriter 			ExampleInfo
	PrintWriter 			and etc.
	and etc.

interfaces
----------
In java, An interface name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined interfaces		userdefined interfaces
	--------------------		------------------
	Serializable			ITest	
	Cloneable			IExampleDemo
	Iterator			IDemoApp
	ListIterator			IRahul
	and etc.			and etc.

variables
----------
In java, A variable name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	---------------			--------------------
	length				empId
	out				studName
	in				rollNo
	err				studFee
	and etc.			and etc.

methods
---------
In java, A method name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined methods		userdefined methods
	-------------------		-------------------
	getClass()			getDetails()
	hashCode()			calculateBillAmt()
	toString()			showDetails()
	getPriority()			getInfo()
	setName()			and etc
	and etc.


keywords
--------
In java, all keywords we need to write under lower case letters only.
ex:
	predefined keywords
	-------------------
	if , else, do , for , public , static , void , class and etc.


packages
--------
In java, all packages we need to write under lower case letters only.

ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	------------------		----------------
	java.lang (default pkg)		com.ihub.www
	java.io				com.google.www
	java.util			and etc.
	java.util.stream
	java.time
	java.text
	java.sql
	javax.servlet 
	and etc.

constants
------------
In java, all constants we need to write under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants		userdefined constants
	-------------------		--------------
	MAX_PRIORITY			LIMIT=10;
	MIN_PRIORITY
	NORM_PRIORITY
	MAX_VALUE
	MIN_VALUE 
	and etc.

Assignment
============
1) class 	:	QualityThought

2) Interface	:	IQualityThought

3) Variable 	:	qualityThought

4) Method 	:	qualityThought()

5) package	:	com.qualitythought.www

6) constant 	:	QUALITYTHOUGHT / QUALITY_THOUGHT

Interview questions
====================

Q) Which package is a default package in java?

   java.lang package 



Q) How many classes are there in java?

   Java 7  -  4024 classes 
   Java 8  -  4240 classes 
   Java 9  -  6005 classes 
   Java 10 -  6002 classes 		


Types of IT companies
----------------------
We have mainly two types of IT companies.

1) Service Based Company 
	ex:
		Cognizent, Capgemini , TCS  and etc.	

2) Product Based Company 
	ex:
		Oracle Corporation, Microsoft , Amazon and etc.
