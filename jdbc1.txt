JDBC
=====
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in RAM.

Once the program exeuction is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our application writing the data into 
files or database softwares.

Files and database softwares act like a performance storage medium or device.

Persistence
===========
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called
persistence.

Important terminologies
=======================
1) Persistence store 
--------------------
	It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long 
	period of time is called persistence store.
	ex:
		Files
		Database softwares 

2) Persistence data 
------------------
	Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
	ex:
		records
		tables 

3) Persistence operations 
---------------------
	Insert,Update,Delete,Select,Create and etc are called persistence operations.
	In realtime this operations are also known as CURD operation, CRUD operation
	or SCUD operation.
	ex:
		C - create	S - select 
		U - update 	C - create 	
		R - read	U - update 
		D - delete 	D - delete 

4) Pesistence logic
--------------------
	A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called 
	persistence logic.
	ex:
		JDBC Code 
		Hibernate code
		Ibatis code 
		IOStream 

5) Persistence technology
---------------------------
	A technology which is used to develop persistence logics is called 
	persistence technology.
	ex:
		JDBC
		Hibernate 
		EJB
		and etc

Q)What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics having 
the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence
store.


Note:
------
				IOStream 
	JavaApp	---------------------------------------------- Files 
			Serialization/Deserialization 


				JDBC Code 
	JavaApp ---------------------------------------------- Database S/W 


Serialization
--------------
The process of take the data from object and storing in a file is called serialization.

In general , Converting from object state to file state is called Serialization.

Diagram: jdbc1.1

In serialization , object will not store in a file.Object data will store in a file.

Deserialization
------------------
The process of taking the data from file and repreasting an object is called 
Deserialization.

In general, converting file state to object state.

Limitations with files as persistence store
===========================================
> We can store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationships.

> It does not allow us to apply constraints i.e primary key,foreign key,not null and etc.

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.

Advantages of Database as persistence store
=========================================
> We can store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> Fetching the data with multiple condition is possible.

> It shows an applicaiton with relationships.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.
