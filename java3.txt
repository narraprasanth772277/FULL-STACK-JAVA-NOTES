Comments in java
=================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Comments will not displayed in output because compiler will not compile the comments.

We have two types of comments in java.

1)Single line comment 
--------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2)Multiple line comment 
---------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			-
			-
		*/

ex:
----
//class declaration 
class Demo
{
	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//variable declaration 
		int i=10;
	
		//output stmt 
		System.out.println(i);
	}
}

Project
========
A project is a collection of modules.
ex:
	registration module
	admin module
	payment module
	login module
	report generation module and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1)Technical Domain 
----------------
	Using which technology we developed our project.
	ex:
		Java

2)Functional Domain 
-------------------
	It describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain 
		Banking domain 
		Insuarance domain 
		ERP domain 
		and etc.	


Q)What is difference between JDK , JRE and JVM ?

JDK
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment(JRE), Java Virtual Machine(JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever(.jar), document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.


JRE
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.

JRE provides very good environment to run java applications only.


JVM
----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

It is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.

and etc.


Q)Who is the responsible to destroy the objects in java?

	Garbage Collector 

Q)Who is the responsible to execute the java program?

	JVM 


Q)In how many ways we can call garbage collector?

There are two ways to call garbage collector in java.

1)System.gc() 

2)Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
